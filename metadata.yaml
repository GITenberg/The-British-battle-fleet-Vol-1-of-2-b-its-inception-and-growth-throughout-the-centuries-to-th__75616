summary: '"The British Battle Fleet, Vol. 1 (of 2): Its Inception and Growth Throughout
  the Centuries" by Fred T. Jane is a historical account written in the early 20th
  century. This work delves into the evolution of the British Navy from its mythic
  beginnings to the sophisticated fleet in contemporary times. The primary focus highlights
  the technological advancements and the shipbuilders’ contributions to naval warfare
  rather than detailing the exploits of admirals and notable battles.  The opening
  of this work sets the stage for an exploration of the origins of British naval power.
  It begins by addressing the obscured and legendary inception of the fleet, moving
  from early myths involving figures like King Alfred to a more factual representation
  of naval developments during his reign and those of subsequent monarchs. Jane emphasizes
  that the establishment of a truly organized Navy stemmed from necessity—a response
  to foreign threats rather than a premeditated strategy—and outlines various periods,
  such as the Norman invasions and the Plantagenet era, that shaped the maritime landscape
  of England. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
